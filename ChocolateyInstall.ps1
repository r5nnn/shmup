# Download and install Chocolatey nupkg from an OData (HTTP/HTTPS) url such as Artifactory, Nexus, ProGet (all of these are recommended for organizational use), or Chocolatey.Server (great for smaller organizations and POCs)
# This is where you see the top level API - with xml to Packages - should look nearly the same as https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/
# If you are using Nexus, always add the trailing slash or it won't work
# === EDIT HERE ===
$packageRepo = 'https://github.com/r5nnn/shmup'

# If the above $packageRepo repository requires authentication, add the username and password here. Otherwise these leave these as empty strings.

# Determine unzipping method
# 7zip is the most compatible, but you need an internally hosted 7za.exe.
# Make sure the version matches for the arguments as well.
# Built-in does not work with Server Core, but if you have PowerShell 5
# it uses Expand-Archive instead of COM
$unzipMethod = 'builtin'
#$unzipMethod = '7zip'
#$7zipUrl = 'https://chocolatey.org/7za.exe' (download this file, host internally, and update this to internal)
